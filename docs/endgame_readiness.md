## No "Rewrite Later" Assumptions

### Current Architecture

**Assumptions:**
- Service-layer architecture is final
- Multi-region architecture is final
- Observability is final
- Security model is final

**No Assumptions:**
- No "rewrite later" assumptions
- No "fix later" assumptions
- No "document later" assumptions
- No "test later" assumptions

---

### Long-Term Viability

**Requirements:**
- Architecture supports 10×-100× growth
- Architecture supports multiple teams
- Architecture supports regulatory requirements
- Architecture supports acquisition scenarios

**Readiness:**
- ✅ Architecture is scalable
- ✅ Architecture is maintainable
- ✅ Architecture is compliant
- ✅ Architecture is acquisition-ready

---

## Notes

- ⚠️ **Endgame readiness is mandatory** - Not optional
- ⚠️ **No "rewrite later" assumptions** - Architecture is final
- ⚠️ **All scenarios are supported** - Acquisition, audit, growth, sell-off
- ⚠️ **Readiness is continuous** - Ongoing maintenance required
