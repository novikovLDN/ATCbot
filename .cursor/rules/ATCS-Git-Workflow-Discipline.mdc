Git workflow rules:
- Never push directly to main unless explicitly instructed.
- All work is done in stage or feature branches.
- Every logical change must end with: commit & push.
- Commits must be atomic and descriptive.
- No mixed refactors + features in a single change.
- If asked for a prompt, produce a precise Cursor-ready prompt, not code unless requested.
